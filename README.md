# Sorting
THIS SORTING FILE HAS ALL TYPES OF SORTING ALGORITHMS 
THERE ARE MANY SORTING ALGORITHMS WHICH SORT THE GIVE INPUT IN LESS TIME COMPLEXCITY AND SOME ARE AT WORST TIME.
AND ANOTHER BETTER WAY OF IMPLEMENTING SORTING AN ARRAY IS USING TREES
IN TREES WE HAVE TRAVERSEAL OPERATION(IN-ORDER).
HEAP(MAX,MIN HEAP) IS ALSO USED IN SORT. THERE ALSO SORTING ALGORITHMS.
AND THIS DEPENDS ON THE ALGORITHM THAT WHAT U DEVELOP TO SLOVE THE PROBLEM.THE TIME COMPLEXITY MAY DIFFERENT IF WHEN U CODE/DEVELOP WRONG ALGORITHM
